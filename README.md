#### 
Other Notes: 
* This game was programmed heavy on OOP (object oriented program) to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of JavaScript. Had to create classes for heroes, enemies, lasers, money, and hover messages & methods for each to draw the on the canvas and animate them. Most of the code is used in JavaScript since I used the html canvas tag (which is popular with browser games)
* Challanges: 
    * Styling & CSS. My current weakness as of September 18, 2022 is visual art & styling a web page to make it look nice and artistic. I am a backend person and my strength is in JavaScript (the brains of the project)
    * I could not find free sprites for characters and enemies that would fit with the style of the game. This was a class project, but still an unfinished product as of September 20, 2022. I will continue to improve the game at later dates. 
* This game was designed to be both challenging and funny. Have fun playing!
