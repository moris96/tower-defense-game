# this is project 1

### ideas for game:
* tower defense 

#### rules: 
* each time you kill a villian, your score increases by 10 
* if a single villian breaks through your defenses you lose! 
* to win you need to defend against 3 rounds of villians, including a final boss in round 3! 
* in each level your laser's power and starting money increases, but enemies become more difficult to kill! 
* points needed to win: 
    * level 1: >= 20
    * level 2: >= 50
    * level 3 (final boss): >= 500
